                "question": "A company hosts a Windows-based file server on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances spread across multiple Availability Zones. The application servers are currently unable to access files simultaneously from this fleet. Which solution will allow simultaneous file access from multiple application servers in the MOST operationally efficient way?",
                "options": { "A": "Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) Multi-AZ file system...", "B": "Create an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server Multi-AZ file system...", "C": "Create an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume that has EBS Multi-Attach enabled...", "D": "Create two Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems. Configure Distributed File System (DFS) replication..." },
                "correctAnswer": "B",
                "explanation": "Amazon FSx for Windows File Server is a fully managed service that provides shared file storage built on Windows Server. It natively supports the SMB protocol, Windows ACLs, and Multi-AZ deployments.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "A: Amazon EFS is designed for Linux-based workloads...\nC: EBS Multi-Attach allows an EBS volume to be attached to multiple instances, but only within the same Availability Zone...\nD: A single Multi-AZ FSx file system is more operationally efficient than managing two separate file systems with DFS replication manually."
            },
            {
                "question": "A company uses AWS Organizations to manage a multi-account environment. They need to automate the creation of daily incremental backups for any Amazon EBS volume tagged with Lifecycle: Production. A key requirement is to prevent users from deleting these production snapshots using their standard EC2 permissions. What should a SysOps administrator do to meet these requirements?",
                "options": { "A": "Create a daily snapshot of all EBS volumes by using Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager...", "B": "Associate a service control policy (SCP) with the account to deny users the ability to delete EBS snapshots...", "C": "Create a daily snapshot of all EBS volumes by using AWS Backup...", "D": "Create a daily Amazon Machine Image (AMI) of every production EC2 instance..." },
                "correctAnswer": "C",
                "explanation": "AWS Backup is a centralized backup service that simplifies the management of backups... Crucially, AWS Backup has a feature called Backup Vault Lock, which can enforce write-once, read-many (WORM) policies.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "A: Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) can automate snapshot creation based on tags, but it does not have a built-in, robust feature like Vault Lock...\nB: This solution is overly complex and has flaws... Using EventBridge to trigger snapshots is less efficient...\nD: The requirement is to back up EBS volumes, not entire EC2 instances."
            },
            {
                "question": "An application runs on hundreds of Amazon EC2 instances distributed across three Availability Zones. This application needs to make calls to a third-party API over the public internet. The third-party provider requires a static list of IP addresses to add to their allow list. Which solution will meet these requirements?",
                "options": { "A": "Add a NAT gateway in the public subnet of each Availability Zone...", "B": "Allocate one Elastic IP address in each Availability Zone...", "C": "Place the instances behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB)...", "D": "Update the main route table to send the traffic to the internet through an Elastic IP address that is assigned to each instance." },
                "correctAnswer": "A",
                "explanation": "This is the classic and recommended architecture for this scenario. By placing a NAT Gateway in each Availability Zone's public subnet and routing outbound traffic from the private subnets through it, all instances in that AZ will appear to originate from the single, static Elastic IP address associated with that NAT Gateway.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "B: An Elastic IP address can only be associated with one EC2 instance at a time...\nC: Load balancers (both NLB and ALB) are designed for managing inbound traffic...\nD: Assigning an Elastic IP address to each of the 'hundreds' of instances is not operationally efficient..."
            },
            {
                "question": "A SysOps administrator is setting up an Amazon S3 bucket to host a static web application. The files have been copied to the bucket. A strict company policy dictates that all S3 buckets must remain private and not be publicly accessible. What should the SysOps administrator do to meet these requirements?",
                "options": { "A": "Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Configure the S3 bucket as an origin with an origin access identity (OAI)...", "B": "Configure static website hosting in the S3 bucket...", "C": "Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)...", "D": "Create an accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator..." },
                "correctAnswer": "A",
                "explanation": "This is the standard and most secure method for this use case. Amazon CloudFront can act as the public-facing entry point. An Origin Access Identity (OAI) is a special CloudFront user that you can grant permissions to access your private S3 bucket.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "B: Configuring static website hosting on an S3 bucket requires the bucket and its objects to be made public...\nC and D: While an ALB or Global Accelerator can route traffic, they are not the primary or most direct services for serving content from S3 while keeping the bucket private."
            },
            {
                "question": "An application running on an Amazon EC2 instance needs to interact with Amazon SQS queues. Specifically, it must be able to read, write, and delete messages. Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST secure manner?",
                "options": { "A": "Create an IAM user with an IAM policy that allows the sqs:SendMessage, sqs:ReceiveMessage, and sqs:DeleteMessage permission...", "B": "Create an IAM user... Export the IAM user's access key...", "C": "Create and associate an IAM role... Attach an IAM policy to the role that allows sqs:* permissions...", "D": "Create and associate an IAM role... Attach an IAM policy to the role that allows the sqs:SendMessage, sqs:ReceiveMessage, and sqs:DeleteMessage permission..." },
                "correctAnswer": "D",
                "explanation": "This option follows two key security best practices. First, it uses an IAM Role associated with the EC2 instance... Second, it adheres to the Principle of Least Privilege by granting only the specific permissions required...",
                "whyOthersWrong": "A and B: Both of these options involve using long-lived IAM user credentials... This is a significant security risk...\nC: While using an IAM role is correct, this option violates the principle of least privilege by using a wildcard (sqs:*)..."
            },
            {
                "question": "A SysOps administrator has configured an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) as the origin... After a week, monitoring shows that requests are still being served directly by the ALB... What are possible causes for this problem? (Choose two.)",
                "options": { "A": "CloudFront does not have the ALB configured as the origin access identity.", "B": "The DNS is still pointing to the ALB instead of the CloudFront distribution.", "C": "The ALB security group is not permitting inbound traffic from CloudFront.", "D": "The default, minimum, and maximum Time to Live (TTL) are set to 0 seconds on the CloudFront distribution.", "E": "The target groups associated with the ALB are configured for sticky sessions." },
                "correctAnswer": "B", // Combining B and D for single answer format
                "explanation": "If the public DNS record still points directly to the ALB's DNS name, users will bypass CloudFront entirely. Additionally, if the Time to Live (TTL) is set to 0, CloudFront will forward every single request to the ALB, effectively disabling caching.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "A: Origin Access Identity (OAI) is used to restrict access to S3 bucket origins, not ALB origins.\nC: If the ALB security group blocked traffic, users would receive errors...\nD: Sticky sessions on the ALB ensure that a user is consistently routed to the same backend... This would not prevent CloudFront from caching content."
            },
            {
                "question": "An Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB cluster has automated backups enabled... A SysOps administrator needs to create a new, separate RDS DB cluster using data that is no more than 24 hours old... Which solutions will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? (Choose two.)",
                "options": { "A": "Identify the most recent automated snapshot. Restore the snapshot to a new RDS DB cluster.", "B": "Back up the database to Amazon S3 by using native database backup tools...", "C": "Create a read replica instance in the original RDS DB cluster. Promote the read replica to a standalone DB cluster.", "D": "Create a new RDS DB cluster. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)...", "E": "Use the pg_dump utility to export data..." },
                "correctAnswer": "A", // Combining A and C
                "explanation": "Restoring from the most recent automated snapshot is a simple, built-in RDS feature... Creating a read replica provides an asynchronously updated, read-only copy of the database. This replica can be 'promoted' to become a new, independent, writeable DB cluster at any time.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "B and E: Using native database tools like pg_dump involves manual steps...\nD: AWS DMS is a powerful service designed for migrating databases... Using it to simply clone an existing RDS cluster is overkill..."
            },
            {
                "question": "A user, authenticated via Active Directory federation, attempts to deploy an AWS CloudFormation template that creates an Amazon S3 bucket. The stack creation fails. Which factors could cause this failure? (Choose two.)",
                "options": { "A": "The user's IAM policy does not allow the cloudformation:CreateStack action.", "B": "The user's IAM policy does not allow the cloudformation:CreateStackSet action.", "C": "The user's IAM policy does not allow the s3:CreateBucket action.", "D": "The user's IAM policy explicitly denies the s3:ListBucket action.", "E": "The user's IAM policy explicitly denies the s3:PutObject action." },
                "correctAnswer": "A", // Combining A and C
                "explanation": "When a user deploys a CloudFormation stack, two sets of permissions are involved: the user's permission to interact with CloudFormation, and CloudFormation's permission to create the resources... the user themselves must have the cloudformation:CreateStack permission... the user needs the s3:CreateBucket permission.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "B: CreateStackSet is for deploying stacks across multiple accounts and regions...\nD and E: The s3:ListBucket and s3:PutObject actions are for interacting with an existing bucket... They are not required for the initial creation of the bucket itself."
            },
            {
                "question": "A company is building a financial application that stores sensitive data in Amazon S3. The data must be encrypted at rest. The company does not want to manage its own encryption keys but requires an audit trail of when and by whom the keys are used. Which solution will meet these requirements?",
                "options": { "A": "Use client-side encryption with client-provided keys...", "B": "Use server-side encryption with S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3)...", "C": "Use server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C)...", "D": "Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS managed encryption keys (SSE-KMS)..." },
                "correctAnswer": "D",
                "explanation": "Server-Side Encryption with AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) meets both requirements perfectly. AWS manages the lifecycle of the keys... Crucially, every time this KMS key is used to encrypt or decrypt an S3 object, the action is logged in AWS CloudTrail.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "A and C: Both of these options involve the company providing and managing their own encryption keys...\nB: Server-Side Encryption with S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)... does not provide a separate, detailed CloudTrail audit log for the usage of the data keys."
            },
            {
                "question": "A company uses AWS Organizations and needs to automate the provisioning of the same set of resources from the management account to multiple member accounts. Which solution will meet this requirement?",
                "options": { "A": "Create an AWS CloudFormation change set...", "B": "Create an AWS CloudFormation nested stack...", "C": "Create an AWS CloudFormation stack set...", "D": "Create an AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template..." },
                "correctAnswer": "C",
                "explanation": "AWS CloudFormation StackSets are designed for this exact purpose. A StackSet allows you to create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions with a single operation.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "A: A change set is a preview of the changes a CloudFormation template will make to a single stack...\nB: A nested stack is a stack that is created as part of another stack... not for deploying across accounts.\nD: AWS SAM... doesn't inherently provide the multi-account deployment capability that StackSets do."
            },
            {
                "question": "A SysOps administrator has created a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI) in the eu-west-2 Region. They need to use this same AMI to launch EC2 instances in two other Regions: us-east-1 and us-east-2. What must the SysOps administrator do to use the custom AMI in the additional Regions?",
                "options": { "A": "Copy the AMI to the additional Regions.", "B": "Make the AMI public in the Community AMIs section...", "C": "Share the AMI to the additional Regions...", "D": "Copy the AMI to a new Amazon S3 bucket..." },
                "correctAnswer": "A",
                "explanation": "AMIs are a regional resource. An AMI created in one AWS Region... can only be used to launch instances in that same Region. To use it in another Region, you must explicitly copy the AMI to the target Region.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "B: Making an AMI public would allow other AWS accounts to use it, but it would still only be available within the Region where it was created.\nC: Sharing an AMI allows other AWS accounts to use your private AMI, but again, this sharing is confined to the Region where the AMI exists...\nD: You cannot simply copy the AMI to an S3 bucket and use it in another region. The correct procedure is the Copy AMI action."
            },
            {
                "question": "A SysOps administrator is setting up a simple, public-facing website on a single EC2 instance... Despite correct security group and NACL inbound rules for HTTP, the website cannot be reached from the internet. What is the cause of this issue?",
                "options": { "A": "The SysOps administrator did not create an outbound rule that allows ephemeral port return traffic in the new network ACL.", "B": "The SysOps administrator did not create an outbound rule in the security group that allows HTTP traffic from port 80.", "C": "The Elastic IP address assigned to the EC2 instance has changed.", "D": "There is an additional network ACL associated with the subnet that includes a rule that denies inbound HTTP traffic from port 80." },
                "correctAnswer": "A",
                "explanation": "Network ACLs (NACLs) are stateless. This means you must explicitly define rules for both inbound and outbound traffic. When a user on the internet sends a request to your server on port 80, the server needs to send the response back... on a random, high-numbered port (an ephemeral port...). The new, custom NACL has an inbound allow rule, but it lacks the corresponding outbound rule to allow this return traffic...",
                "whyOthersWrong": "B: Security Groups are stateful. If you allow inbound traffic on a port, the corresponding return traffic is automatically allowed...\nC: Elastic IP addresses are static by definition...\nD: A subnet can only have one NACL associated with it at a time."
            },
            {
                "question": "A SysOps administrator is designing a disaster recovery (DR) plan for a critical application... The RTO and RPO are both 15 minutes. Which combination of steps should the SysOps administrator take to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose two.)",
                "options": { "A": "Configure Aurora backups to be exported to the DR Region.", "B": "Configure the Aurora cluster to replicate data to the DR Region by using the Aurora global database option.", "C": "Configure the DR Region with an ALB and an Auto Scaling group. Use the same configuration as in the primary Region.", "D": "Configure the DR Region with an ALB and an Auto Scaling group. Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity, maximum capacity, and desired capacity to 1.", "E": "Manually launch a new ALB and a new Auto Scaling group by using AWS CloudFormation during a failover activity." },
                "correctAnswer": "B", // Combining B and D
                "explanation": "This points to a 'Warm Standby' approach. An Aurora Global Database provides fast cross-region replication... this easily meets the 15-minute RPO... For the application tier, you have a scaled-down version of your infrastructure running in the DR region (a single instance). This is more cost-effective than running a full-scale copy...",
                "whyOthersWrong": "A: Restoring a database from a snapshot backup... would likely take longer than 15 minutes...\nC: Running a full-scale copy... would be very expensive...\nE: Manually launching the entire infrastructure from scratch... would take far too long..."
            },
            {
                "question": "A company's VPC... is connected to their on-premises data center via an AWS Site-to-Site VPN... A SysOps administrator then creates new subnets in a new Availability Zone... These new resources cannot communicate with the on-premises environment. Which steps should the SysOps administrator take to resolve the issue?",
                "options": { "A": "Add a route to the route tables of the new subnets that send on-premises traffic to the virtual private gateway.", "B": "Create a ticket with AWS Support to request adding Availability Zones to the Site-to-Site VPN route configuration.", "C": "Establish a new Site-to-Site VPN connection between a virtual private gateway attached to the new Availability Zone and the on-premises data center.", "D": "Replace the Site-to-Site VPN connection with an AWS Direct Connect connection." },
                "correctAnswer": "A",
                "explanation": "When you create new subnets, they are associated with a route table... For instances in these new subnets to communicate with the on-premises network, their subnet route table must have a rule that directs traffic destined for the on-premises network CIDR range to the Virtual Private Gateway (VGW).",
                "whyOthersWrong": "B: The Site-to-Site VPN connection is to the VPC as a whole... It is not tied to a specific Availability Zone.\nC: A single VPN connection to the VGW is sufficient for the entire VPC.\nD: While Direct Connect is another way to establish hybrid connectivity, it is not necessary to solve this simple routing problem."

                "question": "A company has enabled server access logging for all its existing Amazon S3 buckets. They want to implement a solution that continuously monitors the logging settings... and automatically remediates any bucket that does not have logging turned on. What should a SysOps administrator do... in the MOST operationally efficient way?",

Launch an AWS Lambda function for remediation.", "B": "Configure automatic remediation in AWS Config by using the s3-bucket-logging-enabled rule.", "C": "Configure AWS Trusted Advisor to monitor the logging configuration...", "D": "Track the logging information by using Amazon CloudWatch metrics. Launch an AWS Lambda function for remediation." },
                "correctAnswer": "B",
                "explanation": "AWS Config is a service designed specifically for assessing, auditing, and evaluating the configurations of your AWS resources. It has a managed rule called s3-bucket-logging-enabled... AWS Config also supports automatic remediation...",
                "whyOthersWrong": "A and D: While you could build a custom solution... this is reinventing the wheel. AWS Config provides this functionality out of the box...\nC: AWS Trusted Advisor provides recommendations... but it does not offer automated remediation capabilities."

                "question": "A SysOps administrator is configuring an Auto Scaling group for an application. The fleet of EC2 instances must always have 50% CPU available to handle traffic bursts. The load is known to increase significantly every day between 09:00 and 17:00. How should the SysOps administrator configure the scaling...?",

                "whyOthersWrong": "A: A target of 90% CPU utilization leaves only 10% headroom, which violates the 50% availability requirement.\nC: Simply setting the instance counts to 2 and using a scheduled policy doesn't include a dynamic scaling policy...\nD: This option only includes proactive scheduled scaling. It does not have a reactive policy..."

Attach an IAM role to allow the instances to write logs to CloudWatch.", "C": "Install and configure the CloudWatch agent... Attach an IAM user...", "D": "Install and configure the CloudWatch agent... Attach the necessary security groups..." },

This suggests an issue with the end-to-end user experience... An Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics 'heartbeat monitor canary' simulates a user's interaction by loading the specified website URL (FQDN).",
