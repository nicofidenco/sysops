                "question": "A company hosts a Windows-based file server on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances spread across multiple Availability Zones. The application servers are currently unable to access files simultaneously from this fleet. Which solution will allow simultaneous file access from multiple application servers in the MOST operationally efficient way?",
                "options": {
                    "A": "Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) Multi-AZ file system. Copy the files to the EFS file system. Connect the EFS file system to mount points on the application servers.",
                    "B": "Create an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server Multi-AZ file system. Copy the files to the Amazon FSx file system. Adjust the connections from the application servers to use the share that the Amazon FSx file system exposes.",
                    "C": "Create an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume that has EBS Multi-Attach enabled. Create an Auto Scaling group for the Windows file server. Use a script in the file server's user data to attach the Shared FileAccess tag to the EBS volume during launch.",
                    "D": "Create two Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems. Configure Distributed File System (DFS) replication between the file systems. Copy the files to the Amazon FSx file systems. Adjust the connections from the application servers to use the shares that the Amazon FSx file systems expose."
                },
                "correctAnswer": "B",
                "explanation": "Amazon FSx for Windows File Server is a fully managed service that provides shared file storage built on Windows Server. It natively supports the SMB protocol, Windows ACLs, and Multi-AZ deployments. This makes it the perfect fit for providing highly available, shared file access to Windows-based EC2 instances without requiring complex manual configuration.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "A: Amazon EFS is designed for Linux-based workloads and uses the NFS protocol.\nC: EBS Multi-Attach allows an EBS volume to be attached to multiple instances, but only within the same Availability Zone.\nD: A single Multi-AZ FSx file system is more operationally efficient than managing two separate file systems with DFS replication manually."
            },
            {
                "question": "A company uses AWS Organizations to manage a multi-account environment. They need to automate daily incremental backups for any Amazon EBS volume tagged with 'Lifecycle: Production' and prevent users from deleting these snapshots. What should a SysOps administrator do?",
                "options": {
                    "A": "Use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to create daily snapshots based on the tag.",
                    "B": "Use an SCP to deny snapshot deletion and an EventBridge rule to create snapshots.",
                    "C": "Use AWS Backup to create daily snapshots based on the tag and use a Backup Vault Lock.",
                    "D": "Use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to create a daily AMI of every production EC2 instance."
                },
                "correctAnswer": "C",
                "explanation": "AWS Backup is a centralized service that can create tag-based backup plans. Crucially, its Backup Vault Lock feature can enforce write-once, read-many (WORM) policies, preventing anyone from deleting backups before the retention period expires, meeting the deletion prevention requirement.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "A: DLM can automate snapshot creation but lacks a robust feature like Vault Lock to prevent deletion by users with standard permissions.\nB: This is overly complex. An SCP would be a blanket denial, and EventBridge is less efficient than a dedicated backup service.\nD: The requirement is to back up EBS volumes, not entire EC2 instances via AMIs."
            },
            {
                "question": "An application on hundreds of EC2 instances across three AZs needs to call a third-party API that requires a static list of IP addresses for their allow list. Which solution meets this requirement?",
                "options": {
                    "A": "Add a NAT gateway in the public subnet of each AZ and make it the default route for private subnets.",
                    "B": "Allocate one Elastic IP address in each AZ and associate it with all instances in that AZ.",
                    "C": "Place the instances behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB) and send traffic through the NLB's private IP.",
                    "D": "Update the main route table to send traffic through an Elastic IP assigned to each instance."
                },
                "correctAnswer": "A",
                "explanation": "This is the classic architecture for this scenario. Placing a NAT Gateway in each AZ's public subnet and routing outbound traffic from private subnets through it makes all instances in that AZ appear to originate from the single, static Elastic IP of that NAT Gateway. This provides a stable solution with only three IP addresses for the third party.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "B: An Elastic IP can only be associated with one EC2 instance at a time.\nC: Load balancers are for managing inbound traffic to instances, not for routing outbound traffic from them.\nD: Assigning an Elastic IP to hundreds of instances is inefficient, costly, and results in a long list of IPs, defeating the purpose."
            },
            {
                "question": "A SysOps administrator is setting up an S3 bucket for a static web application. A strict company policy dictates that all S3 buckets must remain private. How can the content be served publicly while keeping the bucket private?",
                "options": {
                    "A": "Create a CloudFront distribution with the S3 bucket as an origin, using an origin access identity (OAI).",
                    "B": "Configure static website hosting in the S3 bucket and use Route 53 to point a CNAME to the S3 endpoint.",
                    "C": "Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and forward traffic to the S3 bucket.",
                    "D": "Create an accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator and set the endpoint to forward traffic to the S3 bucket."
                },
                "correctAnswer": "A",
                "explanation": "This is the standard and most secure method. Amazon CloudFront acts as the public entry point. An Origin Access Identity (OAI) is a special CloudFront user that can be granted permission to access your private S3 bucket. The S3 bucket policy is configured to only allow access from this OAI, keeping the bucket private from all other public access.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "B: Configuring static website hosting on an S3 bucket requires the bucket itself to be made public, which violates the policy.\nC & D: While an ALB or Global Accelerator can route traffic, CloudFront with OAI is the purpose-built solution for securely serving content from a private S3 bucket."
            },
            {
                "question": "An application on an EC2 instance needs to read, write, and delete messages from Amazon SQS queues. Which solution is the MOST secure?",
                "options": {
                    "A": "Create an IAM user with the required permissions and embed the credentials in the application's configuration.",
                    "B": "Create an IAM user with the required permissions and export the access keys as environment variables on the EC2 instance.",
                    "C": "Create and associate an IAM role with the instance, attaching a policy that allows 'sqs:*' permissions.",
                    "D": "Create and associate an IAM role with the instance, attaching a policy that allows only 'sqs:SendMessage', 'sqs:ReceiveMessage', and 'sqs:DeleteMessage' permissions."
                },
                "correctAnswer": "D",
                "explanation": "This option follows two key security best practices: using an IAM Role for the EC2 instance (which is superior to IAM user credentials because keys are automatically rotated) and adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege by granting only the specific permissions required rather than a broad wildcard.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "A & B: Using long-lived IAM user credentials on an instance is a significant security risk. IAM roles are the recommended alternative.\nC: While using an IAM role is correct, this option violates the principle of least privilege by using a wildcard ('sqs:*'), granting far more permissions than needed."
            },
            {
                "question": "A SysOps administrator has configured a CloudFront distribution with an ALB as the origin. After a week, monitoring shows requests are still being served by the ALB, not CloudFront. What are two possible causes?",
                "options": {
                    "A": "CloudFront does not have the ALB configured as an OAI.",
                    "B": "The DNS is still pointing to the ALB instead of the CloudFront distribution.",
                    "C": "The ALB security group is not permitting inbound traffic from CloudFront.",
                    "D": "The default, minimum, and maximum Time to Live (TTL) are set to 0 seconds on the CloudFront distribution.",
                    "E": "The target groups associated with the ALB are configured for sticky sessions."
                },
                "correctAnswer": "B",
                "explanation": "If the public DNS record (e.g., www.example.com) still points directly to the ALB, users will bypass CloudFront entirely. Also, if the Time to Live (TTL) in CloudFront's cache behavior is set to 0, CloudFront will forward every single request to the ALB, effectively disabling caching.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "A: Origin Access Identity (OAI) is used for S3 bucket origins, not ALB origins.\nC: If the security group blocked traffic, users would receive errors, not successfully served content.\nE: Sticky sessions on the ALB would not prevent CloudFront from caching content."
            },
            {
                "question": "An RDS for PostgreSQL DB cluster has automated backups enabled. A SysOps administrator needs to create a new, separate RDS DB cluster using data that is no more than 24 hours old. Which two solutions have the LEAST operational overhead?",
                "options": {
                    "A": "Identify the most recent automated snapshot. Restore the snapshot to a new RDS DB cluster.",
                    "B": "Back up the database to Amazon S3 by using native database backup tools.",
                    "C": "Create a read replica instance in the original RDS DB cluster. Promote the read replica to a standalone DB cluster.",
                    "D": "Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate data.",
                    "E": "Use the pg_dump utility to export data from the original cluster."
                },
                "correctAnswer": "A", // Note: The original doc had A and C as correct. Merging for single-choice.
                "explanation": "Restoring from the most recent automated snapshot is a simple, built-in RDS feature that can be done with a few clicks or a single API call, representing very low operational overhead. Creating a read replica and promoting it is also a standard, low-overhead operation.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "B, D, E: Using native database tools like pg_dump or a service like AWS DMS involves significantly more manual steps and configuration than using the built-in RDS features of snapshot restoration and read replica promotion."
            },
            {
                "question": "A user, authenticated via Active Directory federation, fails to deploy a CloudFormation template that creates an S3 bucket. Which two factors could cause this failure?",
                "options": {
                    "A": "The user's IAM policy does not allow the cloudformation:CreateStack action.",
                    "B": "The user's IAM policy does not allow the cloudformation:CreateStackSet action.",
                    "C": "The user's IAM policy does not allow the s3:CreateBucket action.",
                    "D": "The user's IAM policy explicitly denies the s3:ListBucket action.",
                    "E": "The user's IAM policy explicitly denies the s3:PutObject action."
                },
                "correctAnswer": "A", // Note: The original doc had A and C as correct. Merging for single-choice.
                "explanation": "When a user deploys a CloudFormation stack, two sets of permissions are involved. First, the user themselves must have the 'cloudformation:CreateStack' permission. Second, CloudFormation acts on behalf of the user, so the user's credentials must also include the permissions needed to create the resources in the template, in this case, 's3:CreateBucket'.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "B: 'CreateStackSet' is for deploying stacks across multiple accounts and regions.\nD & E: 's3:ListBucket' and 's3:PutObject' are for interacting with an existing bucket, not for its initial creation."

                "question": "A company is building a financial application that stores sensitive data in S3. The data must be encrypted at rest. The company does not want to manage its own keys but requires an audit trail of when and by whom the keys are used. Which solution meets these requirements?",
                "options": {
                    "A": "Use client-side encryption with client-provided keys.",
                    "B": "Use server-side encryption with S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3).",
                    "C": "Use server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C).",
                    "D": "Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS managed encryption keys (SSE-KMS)."
                },
                "correctAnswer": "D",
                "explanation": "Server-Side Encryption with AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) meets both requirements perfectly. AWS manages the lifecycle of the keys, but the company retains control over the key's policy. Crucially, every time this KMS key is used, the action is logged in AWS CloudTrail, providing the required detailed audit trail.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "A & C: These options involve the company managing their own keys.\nB: SSE-S3 does not provide a separate, detailed CloudTrail audit log for the usage of the data keys."

                },
                "correctAnswer": "C",
                "explanation": "AWS CloudFormation StackSets are designed for this exact purpose. A StackSet allows you to create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions with a single operation from a central management account.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "A: A change set is a preview of changes for a single stack.\nB: A nested stack is a way to reuse template components within a single parent stack.\nD: AWS SAM is for defining serverless applications and doesn't inherently provide multi-account deployment capability."

                },
                "correctAnswer": "A",
                "explanation": "AMIs are a regional resource. An AMI created in one AWS Region can only be used to launch instances in that same Region. To use it in another Region, you must explicitly copy the AMI to the target Region. This creates a new, independent AMI in the destination Region.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "B & C: Making an AMI public or sharing it allows other accounts to use it, but only within the Region where it was created.\nD: You cannot simply copy the AMI to an S3 bucket to use it in another region; the correct procedure is the Copy AMI action."

                "correctAnswer": "A",
                "explanation": "Network ACLs (NACLs) are stateless. You must define rules for both inbound and outbound traffic. When a user sends a request to your server on port 80, the server needs to send the response back to the user's computer on a random, high-numbered (ephemeral) port. The new, custom NACL has an inbound allow rule but lacks the corresponding outbound rule to allow this return traffic.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "B: Security Groups are stateful; if you allow inbound traffic, the return traffic is automatically allowed.\nC: Elastic IP addresses are static by definition.\nD: A subnet can only have one NACL associated with it at a time."

                "explanation": "This describes a 'Warm Standby' approach. An Aurora Global Database provides fast cross-region replication (RPO < 1 second) and fast failover (low RTO). For the application tier, having a scaled-down version running in the DR region (a single instance) is more cost-effective than a full-scale copy. During a failover, you can redirect traffic and then quickly scale up the Auto Scaling group.",
                "whyOthersWrong": "A: Restoring from a snapshot would likely take longer than 15 minutes and not meet the RPO.\nC: Running a full-scale copy ('Hot Standby') is more expensive than required for a 15-minute RTO.\nE: Manually launching the infrastructure would take too long to meet the 15-minute RTO."
