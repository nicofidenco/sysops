        "explanation": "Correct Answer: C [cite: 14]\nExplanation: A connection timeout error is a classic sign that a firewall is blocking the traffic before it can reach the destination. [cite: 15] In AWS, the primary firewall protecting an EC2 instance is its Security Group. [cite: 16] By default, security groups deny all inbound traffic. [cite: 17] To connect to a Linux instance using SSH, you must explicitly allow inbound traffic on TCP port 22. [cite: 17] Modifying the security group to add an inbound rule for port 22 from the administrator's specific IP address is the correct and most secure solution. [cite: 17]",
        "wrongExplanation": "Why the others are wrong: [cite: 18]\nA: Route tables control the flow of traffic between subnets and to destinations outside the VPC (like the internet via an Internet Gateway). [cite: 19] They do not filter traffic to a specific instance based on port or IP. [cite: 20] The instance is in a public subnet, which should already have a route to the Internet Gateway. [cite: 21]\nB: This is incorrect for two reasons. [cite: 22] First, the problem is with inbound traffic to the instance, not outbound. [cite: 22] Second, Network ACLs are stateless, but they are less commonly the cause of initial connection issues than security groups. [cite: 23] The default Network ACL allows all traffic. [cite: 24]\nD: The connection attempt is an inbound request to the EC2 instance. [cite: 25] An outbound rule controls traffic leaving the instance.

[cite: 794] Why A is correct: Network ACLS (NACLs) are stateless. [cite: 795] This means you must explicitly define rules for both inbound and outbound traffic. [cite: 796] When a user on the internet sends a request to your server on port 80, the server needs to send the response back. [cite: 797] This response traffic will originate from the server (on port 80) and be destined for the user's computer on a random, high-numbered port (an ephemeral port, typically in the range 1024-65535). [cite: 798] The new, custom NACL has an inbound allow rule, but it lacks the corresponding outbound rule to allow this return traffic to leave the subnet.

[cite: 802]\nWhy C is incorrect: Elastic IP addresses are static by definition and do not change unless you explicitly disassociate or release them.

        "explanation": "Correct Answers: A and B [cite: 959]\nExplanation:\nThe problem is specifically stated as being caused by excessive read traffic. [cite: 961] Why A is correct: An RDS Read Replica is a read-only copy of your primary database. [cite: 962] You can direct your application's read queries to the replica, which offloads the read traffic from the primary writeable instance. [cite: 963] This is a primary strategy for scaling the read capacity of a relational database. [cite: 964] Why B is correct: Amazon ElastiCache provides an in-memory cache. [cite: 965] By caching frequently requested data (the results of common read queries), the application can retrieve the data from the fast in-memory cache instead of hitting the database every time. [cite: 966] This dramatically reduces the read load on the database. [cite: 967]",
        "wrongExplanation": "Why C is incorrect: Migrating to DynamoDB (a NoSQL database) from a relational database is a massive architectural change and not a simple \"performance improvement \". [cite: 968] It may not even be suitable for the application's data model. [cite: 969]\nWhy D is incorrect: Migrating from a managed service (RDS) to a self-managed database on EC2 increases operational overhead. [cite: 970] While enhanced networking improves network performance, the bottleneck is described as resource overutilization from reads, not network throughput. [cite: 971]\nWhy E is incorrect: A Multi-AZ deployment is a high-availability and disaster recovery feature. [cite: 972] It creates a synchronous standby replica in a different AZ for failover purposes. [cite: 973] It does not improve performance or offload read traffic; the standby instance is not accessible for read queries. [cite: 974]"
